# Sentiment-Analysis-using-ELM
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was first proposed by Huang in 2006, targets keeping away from time-costing iterative preparation process and further developing the speculation execution. ELM is a training algorithm for single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), which converges much faster than traditional methods and yields promising performance. Theoretical analysis showed that ELM are more likely to reach global optimal solution with random parameters than traditional networks with all the parameters to be trained. ELM tends to yield better classification performance with less optimization constrains. ELM randomly sets the weights between the input layer and the hidden layer. Then ELM randomly sets the bias of the hidden layer neurons and then the training the network is to decide these parameters that reach the optimal solution .

#### Limitations
Due to some limitations algorithm didnot achieve the desired output or outperform the performance because of the number of Hidden node required is high also accuracy obtained over multiple run has high variance in test accuracy due to random input weight.

Future work will be improving these limitations and the performance of ELM.
